        <h1>The Path Game Simulation</h1>

        <p> This app will allow the user to view conversations with different people as if they worked for a specific agency.
            It mimics a "mandatory training guide" the company offers their employees to practice their skills of interaction. The
            dialogs will be presented in forms of a parody of how the employer / a client / or even a coworker treat
            their fellow employee regarding work topics such as (promotion, credit, deadlines, compensation, fairness,
            respect. patience, etc.) The dialogs on its own are a set of events that happen to many, presented as a form
            of ironic jokes. </p>
        <p> (Changes) For this proposal, depending on the ammount of work, timing and coding difficulty, the dialog
            answers will be pre-written. And simply act as a sequel of people who had terrible experience in their
            working environment (A superior, A client or a Coworker). > Html Narrative </p>

                <p> After leaving the "Login" page, the user will be redirected to the "Homepage". The homepage includes
                    a welcome note and 3 links to different quiz scenarios the user can participate in. It also includes
                    a sticky dropdown menu on the left side to navigate. A little useless helper chatbox will also
                    follow the user throughout the website at the bottom right corner.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The links will lead to a simulation page that has an interactive scenario chatbox. Two answers that
                    lead to different responces from the recipient.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p> The chosen path may lead to different responses or possibly a different ending.</p>
